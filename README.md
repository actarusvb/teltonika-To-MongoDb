# teltonika-To-MongoDb
very simple server receiving messages from Teltonika device and store into mongoDb

very simple server under nodejs to receive TCP messages from devices (GPS Traker) and store into mongo.
Not realy refined, this is a working in progres but is working.

Most of code is just to log to console data received, can be commented out but is nice to see in PM2 log what you are receiving.

Need to test on large numeber of device at same time.
